<li>AI in Astronomy</li>
Artificial intelligence can be very helpful in solving the complex problems of the universe. Artificial intelligence technology can be useful for understanding the universe like how it works, its origin, etc.

<li>AI in Healthcare</li>
In the past five to ten years, artificial intelligence has become more beneficial to the healthcare industry and will have a huge impact on this industry.
The healthcare industry applies artificial intelligence to make better and faster diagnosis than humans. Artificial intelligence can help doctors with diagnosis and can report when patients get worse so that medical help can reach the patient before hospitalization.

<li>AI in Gaming</li>
Artificial intelligence can be used for games. Artificial intelligence machines can play strategy games like chess, as the machine needs to think about a large number of possible places.

<li>AI in Finance</li>
The AI ​​and finance industries are a better match for each other. The finance industry implements automation, chatbot, adaptive intelligence, algorithmic trading and machine learning in financial operations.

<li>AI in Data Security</li>
Data security is crucial for every company and cyber attacks are growing very rapidly in the digital world. Artificial intelligence can be used to make your data safer and more secure. Some examples such as the AEG bot and AI2 Platform are used to better identify software errors and cyber attacks.

<li>AI in Robotics</li>
Artificial intelligence has a prominent role in robotics. Usually, general robots are programmed so that they can perform some repetitive tasks, but with the help of artificial intelligence, we can create smart robots that can perform tasks with their own experiences without preprogramming.
Human robots are the best examples of artificial intelligence in robots, and a smart human robot named Erica and Sophia has been developed that can speak and act like humans.

<li>AI in education</li>
AI can automate grades so that the teacher can have more time to teach. AI AI chat software can communicate with students as a teaching assistant.
Artificial intelligence in the future can act as a personal virtual teacher for students, which can be easily accessed anytime and anywhere.
